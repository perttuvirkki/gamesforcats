Games For Bored Cats is a simple touchscreen game designed for real cats.

Put your phone down and let your cat play — moving objects appear on the screen and react when tapped by curious paws. No rules, no scores, no learning curve. Just motion, interaction, and instinct.

You can play together with your cat, or just sit back and watch the chaos unfold.
